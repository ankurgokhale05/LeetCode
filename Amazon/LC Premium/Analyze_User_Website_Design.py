We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: 
The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.







I know most python guys know them well and good at reading compacted 1-line python code. I would like to break it down a little bit. I actually spent 1 hour to try those python packages. "Counter" looks more like dict.. and "combination" is to return an array of different combinations. Hope the code below might help people who would like to read. (Interesting enough I didn't know we can put "dict" into sorted(), and only return keys as an array).

        for t, u, w in sorted_packed_tuple:     # joe: [home, about, career]  websites in list are in ascending timestamp order

            for comb in combs:
                counter_dict[comb] += 1       # Tuple as key, counter as value,  e.g. ('home', 'about', 'career') : 2
        
        sorted_counter_dict = sorted(counter_dict, key=lambda x: (-counter_dict[x], x)) # sort descending by value, then lexicographically
